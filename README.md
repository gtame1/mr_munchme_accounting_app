## Mix Tasks

### Diagnostic & Fix Tasks

#### Fix Withdrawal Accounts
Fixes historical withdrawal entries that incorrectly debited Owner's Equity (3000) instead of Owner's Drawings (3100).

```sh
MIX_ENV=prod mix fix_withdrawal_accounts           # Dry run - shows what would be fixed
MIX_ENV=prod mix fix_withdrawal_accounts --fix     # Apply the fix
```

#### Fix Gift Order Accounting
Fixes accounting entries for orders that were delivered as regular sales but later marked as gifts (`is_gift = true`). Reverses the original sale/COGS entries, records the gift expense (Dr Samples & Gifts 6070, Cr WIP 1220), and reclassifies any payments as gift contributions (Cr Other Income 4100) so AR and Customer Deposits stay clean.

```sh
MIX_ENV=prod mix fix_gift_order_accounting           # Dry run - shows what would be fixed
MIX_ENV=prod mix fix_gift_order_accounting --fix     # Apply the corrections
```

#### Diagnose COGS
Diagnoses and fixes duplicate COGS journal entries caused by pattern matching issues.

```sh
MIX_ENV=prod mix diagnose_cogs           # Dry run - shows duplicates
MIX_ENV=prod mix diagnose_cogs --fix     # Remove duplicates
```

#### Backfill Movement Costs
Backfills costs for inventory movements that have $0 cost (useful when movements were recorded before purchases).

```sh

```

#### Repair Inventory Quantities
Recalculates and repairs inventory quantities from movements.
